The application we created ,i.e. ByIte is based on giving a fresh outlook to E-Commerce.
The user at the start of the application gives 3 options to choose from to the user which are
(1) Shopping
Where the user can browse through a lot of categories such as footwear, apparels, books etc. 
and further sub categories such as casual shoes, formal shoes and sports shoes.Once the desired 
product are selected one can set filters onto them such as a certain price range and then forget about it.

Once the user is in the vicinity of the option/category in a shopping mall or so, he/she is notified
on the application (only for selected items and filters) using beacons which are put up on each rack 
of the shop, and further connected the back end which holds the details of all products in that rack.

The user then on encountering the selected option gets a tinder like screen where the relevant items under 
that category are displayed, on a right swipe the item is rejected, on left swipe it is added to the cart. 
Once all the items required are done with the user can choose to pay for the selections using bit coins by a 
button press event. On pressing the "Pay By BitCoin" option, the user gets a QRCode containing the details
about total amount to be paid and his/her CoinSecure id and Password triggering an ask call,using bit coins for
the purchase, onto scanning the QRCode the purchase details are specified.

(2) Scan
If not through the shopping section the user can simply scan the QRCode of any product which is listed in 
out Database, and make a payment again using BitCoin (the Trade API).

(3) BitCoins Accepted Here
This option is used to either check the in trade fiat balance or the actual fiat balance, of the user.
And also place bids on bitCoins and ask for Trade (Using the Trade API or CoinSecure).
