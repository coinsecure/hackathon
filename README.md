### Coinsecure - Bitcoin Hackathon in India.

Coinsecure has been working constantly to refine and create an ecosystem around Bitcoin in India.

With this in mind, we are now working towards an initiative to get more Developers across India learning and building on Bitcoin.

We are looking for the 3 best applications that can be built for trading leverage using the Coinsecure's api.

We are looking at this as an opportunity to further test and refine our API, generate more interest around Bitcoin development and integration.

Rules, etc to be published over the coming days. 

We have api.coinsecureis.cool and coinsecure.info/docs that can be used.

Developers should use TESTNET - https://coinsecureis.cool

API Key's can be generated post login here - https://coinsecureis.cool/api
